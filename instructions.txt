Cost collection parsing
At Metry, we use electronically generated pdf invoices to extract energy cost data of our customers. In the attachment you are given a parsed (from a pdf document) district heating invoice in raw text format. We would like to extract necessary information from the parsed text file to persist it in our database then we can present it to our customer.

Your class/method/function will receive a string as input which is the output of pdf to text library (see source.txt), begin writing something to take that unstructured text and return structured data containing the following information extracted from the text input.

-	Invoice period (Fakturaperiod in swedish) -
-	Building id (Anl.nr abbreviated in swedish)
-	Meter number (MÃ¤tarnr abbreviated in swedish)
-	Total cost excluding vat (Summa excl moms in swedish)
-	Total cost including vat
-	Energy price
-	Effect price
-	Flow price
